Sentiment Analysis Project Work Description



This project uses a speech transcript dataset for NLP-driven sentiment analysis. 
The text data undergoes preprocessing steps including tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and frequency analysis.
Using NLTK’s VADER sentiment model, each token is assigned polarity scores to classify words into positive, negative, and neutral categories.
The workflow involves extracting sentiment distributions, identifying high-impact sentiment words, and analyzing overall emotional tone. 
Visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) support interpretation of sentiment trends, enabling structured insights from unstructured language data.
